# When writing pseudocode, the object is to break down the problem into small steps, but the key is that these steps should mimic the lines you write when you work through your initial solution.

# There are three best practices I want you to keep in mind when you write pseudocode. First, capitalize language-specific keywords (IF, ELSE, BREAK, etc). Second, write your pseudocode line-by-line as you would write your actual code. Just make sure itâ€™s in plain English (no symbols, code-specific terminology). Finally, indent your pseudocode as you would your actual code. This means indenting code blocks, conditionals, and the like whenever written.
