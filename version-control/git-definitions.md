# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is the practice of keeping changes to projects separate from one another, and creating 'checkpoints'. This is sueful because it is a safeguard - against conflicts, mistakes, etc. It also helps keep workflows organized, not just one a team but working solo too. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch is when you are going to work on a small portion of a project and you create a separate workspace to hold that code. It keeps the code for that feature in an easy to read/find place and also helps to organize the project and keep features separate. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is when you've completed some work on a branch and want to submit it to be saved as part of the project. A good commit message is descriptive!
* What is a merge conflict?
	When you merge a branch and there is a problem involving things like two people changing the same line of code or someone deleting a line of code - git will tell you that you have a conflict. It's a problem that git can not solve on its own. It needs you (or someone) to actually look at teh conflict locations and see what happened and then make a decision regarding which branch to keep.
