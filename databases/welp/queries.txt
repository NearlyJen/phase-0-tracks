1) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three? You just create multiple joins as seen in the query for the next question.
2) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.


SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comments
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN businesses
        ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

3) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comments
FROM reviews
    JOIN users
        ON users.id = reviews.user_id
    JOIN businesses
        ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
    WHERE business_id = 1;
