* I'm going to first look at w3schools and read their summaries and possibly look at their tutorial
* Break
* Look at Codecademy with w3schools open on the side
* Break
* Get my eyes lasered and sleep the rest of the day.
* I'll take this route because I've done it before and it works for me.

* as usual, it was better to go through w3schools first because my eyes glaze over on codecadamy and they help you too much. skimming w3schools helps me to know what my options are and where to find them later.
